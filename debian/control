Description: Data access library for the MeerKAT project 
 This package serves as a data access library to the HDF5 files produced by the
 Fringe Finder, KAT-7 and MeerKAT data capturing systems. It uses memory
 carefully, allowing files to be inspected and partially loaded into memory.
 Data sets may be concatenated and split via a flexible selection mechanism.
 In addition, it provides a script to convert these HDF5 files to CASA
 MeasurementSets.
